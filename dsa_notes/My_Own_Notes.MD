# For easy questions,

- usually it consists of 1 concept.

# For medium questions,

- usually it consists of at least 2 concepts.

# For hard questions,

- usually there are multiple ways of solving the question,
- but there is always one solution that is better than the rest
- the question that is asking usually has another view to it.

# Tools at your disposals

- Nothing is off the table

## Regular arrays or strings

- for simple problems, not only easy, but the problem does not neeed a more complex data structure

## Stacks, could be multiples

- Regular stacks
- Monotonic stacks, both ways, could be multiples stacks also

## Queues, could be multiples

- Regular queues, could be mutliples

### Heaps, Could be multiples

- Specialized queues that is ordered
- Priority queues or heap
- Indexed priority queues
- Fibonacci priority queues

## Hashmap or Hashsets or Hashtables

- Counters, for counting frequency
-

## Trees

- most common is binary trees
- binary search trees
- sometimes need different tree traversal algo for different questions.
- BFS or DFS
- detect cycles, paths, heights, widths, sum, etc...

## Graphs

- for medium to hard questions
-

## Tries or Prefix Trees

## Algorithms

- prefix sum
- two pointers
- sliding windows
- modular arithmetic - for dealing with large numbers
- dynamic programming
- greedy
- backtracking
- bit manipulations
- discrete math knowledge
- searching
- sorting

## Uncommon data structures (variations of data structures)

- Skip lists
